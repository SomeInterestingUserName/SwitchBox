# SwitchBox

<img src="assets/img/SwitchBox.png" width="25%"/>

SwitchBox is a software-based MIDI translator that can change the channel of incoming MIDI messages in real time. Quickly change instrument voices on a sampler or software synth with the touch of a button. Re-route as many instruments as you like. SwitchBox is designed to be easy to set up and simple to use, so you can get back to making music. 

# How it Works

SwitchBox provides a virtual MIDI port to interface with your audio software. These virtual MIDI ports act exactly like real MIDI ports, and most programs wonâ€™t be able to tell the difference.

SwitchBox lets you change the channel of incoming MIDI messages.
Keystrokes and other controls are re-routed to the currently-active channel.

# Developing for SwitchBox

You're here because you want to see how SwitchBox works, or you're interested in developing for SwitchBox. That's fantastic! Here's what you'll need to do:


1. Clone or download this repository.

   `git clone https://github.com/SomeInterestingUserName/SwitchBox`


2. Go into the folder that was just created.
3. Install programs necessary to run SwitchBox (Consult your distribution's documentation for instructions):
  * **Python 3.x** (`python3`) (Any version of Python 3, although tested on Python 3.7+)
  * **Tkinter for Python** (`python3-tkinter`) Usually bundled with Python, but install manually if you're getting errors. 
  * **Pip** (`python3-pip`) Optional, but makes the next step easier.
4. Install libraries that SwitchBox uses:
  * **RTMidi** (`rtmidi`) installed with pip: `pip3 install rtmidi`
  * **LXML** (`lxml`) installed with pip: `pip3 install lxml`
5. The main program is located at `src/SwitchBox.py`. Run it in the command line:

   `python3 ./SwitchBox.py`

6. That's it! You're now an official SwitchBox developer!

# Repository Layout
* `src` contains the actual source code for SwitchBox, plus images and other resources.
    * `assets` is where the images and resources are stored. There's also a user manual in here.
* `docs` contains this `README` file, plus the pictures and resources for SwitchBox's GitHub Pages site.
* `deploy` is a place to build SwitchBox into an executable file. It contains Python scripts that can be used with `py2app` to build these executables.
